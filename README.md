# Comp576_Final_Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code implementation for enhancing physical commonsense reasoning in language models. The project fine-tunes pre-trained models like GPT-2 and RoBERTa on the Physical Interaction Question Answering (PIQA) dataset. Using **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, the project optimizes computational efficiency while improving model performance on tasks requiring physical commonsense reasoning.
